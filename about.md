Huskycode is a community project spin off from [Agile66](http://www.facebook.com/groups/agile66) to help developers meet online and practice Agile in safe settings. Member contributes 2-3 hours a week to the project. We aim to practice all aspects of Agile, from Sprint Planning, Lean Startup to Continuous Delivery. Mostly what the team feels like trying and regulary do retrospective on the outcome. It is customary for our projects to present our findings in Agile Thailand and Agile Tour Bangkok. You can catch us at those events.
